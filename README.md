# Minecraft-server-tool
A very simple and definitly not perfect but very usefull tool for minecraft servers 

## About the project
### Disclaimer
This app has been made in a rush there might still be some hidden bugs. I am not responsible if you have a problem with your server.
### What is it for
The goal of this application is to be able to ***start and close a minecraft*** server **remotely** from a windows pc to another windows pc (i haven't tried on linux)

## Getting started
You juste have to download the executable files. [**McServerTool**](https://github.com/UnlikelyBuddy1/Minecraft-server-tool/releases/download/1/McServerTool.rar) for **servers** and [**McClientTool**](https://github.com/UnlikelyBuddy1/Minecraft-server-tool/releases/download/1/McClientTool.rar) for the **clients**, once downloaded and unZipped
- **Client**
Put the "client" folder wherever you want and inside it find the "client.exe" file. You **MUST** execute the file within the "client" folder. If that bothers you, you can just make a shortcut and problem solved !
- **Server**
Take the entirety of the content of the McServerTool folder and copy-paste it to your Minecraft server folder. Launch the McServerTool.exe from within the Minecraft server folder and voil√† ! Now all that's left to do is to set up a **Port**. If you plan on using this outside of your local network please **Don't forget to OPEN PORTS on WINDOWS FIREWALL** and to **Port forward it on your ISP control website** (usually 192.168.1.1), and then use the ip+port on the client to start and stop the server !
